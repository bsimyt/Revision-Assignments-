### Part A
### **Question 1 â€“ Customer Discount Correction System**
**[Total: 17 marks]**

A retail store uses a transaction system to record each customer's purchase at checkout. Each customer has a name, purchase amount, loyalty tier, and the hour of purchase (in 24-hour format). The store operates from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM (21:00).

Due to a software bug, a **flat 5% discount** was mistakenly applied to all customers during the **last hour of operation (20:00â€“21:00)**. The correct discount policy is based on loyalty:

- **Bronze**: 5%
- **Silver**: 10%
- **Gold**: 25%

The system currently stores customers in a **singly linked list** in the order they checked out.

---

### **Given Classes:**

```java
class Customer {
    private String name;
    private double lastPurchase;  // already reduced by 5% due to bug
    private String loyaltyTier;   // "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold"
    private int hour;             // 9 to 21 (24-hour format)

    public Customer(String name, double lastPurchase, String loyaltyTier, int hour) {
        this.name = name;
        this.lastPurchase = lastPurchase;
        this.loyaltyTier = loyaltyTier;
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public double getLastPurchase() { return lastPurchase; }
    public String getLoyaltyTier() { return loyaltyTier; }
    public int getHour() { return hour; }

    // Setter
    public void setLastPurchase(double amount) { this.lastPurchase = amount; }

    // Returns correct discount rate
    public double getCorrectDiscountRate() {
        switch(loyaltyTier) {
            case "Gold": return 0.25;
            case "Silver": return 0.10;
            case "Bronze": return 0.05;
            default: return 0.05;
        }
    }
}
```

```java
class TransactionLog {
    private Node head;

    private class Node {
        Customer customer;
        Node next;

        public Node(Customer customer) {
            this.customer = customer;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    public TransactionLog() {
        head = null;
    }

    // Adds customer to the end of the list (chronological order)
    public void addCustomer(Customer customer) {
        Node newNode = new Node(customer);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }
}
```

### **(a)**
Write a method in the `TransactionLog` class called:
```java
public void correctLastHourDiscounts()
```
This method must:
- Traverse the **entire linked list**
- Identify customers who checked out between **20:00 and 21:00 (inclusive)**
- For each such customer:
    - **Reverse the incorrect 5% discount**
    - Apply the **correct discount** based on loyalty tier
    - Update the `lastPurchase` with the corrected value


**[8 marks]**

**Answer:**
```java 
public void correctLastHourDiscount(){
        Node.current=head.current;
        while(!current!=null){
            if(current.getHour>=20&&current.getHour<=21){
                double original=current.getLastPurchase()/0.95;
                double correct=(1-current.getloyalty())*original;
                current.setLastPurchase(correct);
            }
            current=current.next;
        }
}
```

### **(b)**
Explain why using a **singly linked list** is **inefficient** for this type of operation â€” especially if the store needs to **frequently correct the most recent transactions**.

Suggest a **better data structure** for storing transactions when **recent entries need to be accessed or modified quickly**, and justify your choice.

**[4 marks]**

---
**Answer**

In a singly linked list each node only has a reference to the next node and not the previous. To access the last few items you need to iterate through the whole linked list starting from the head, for a larger set of data this is extremely time consuming and having to do it repetitively is inefficient.

A better data structure for storing transactions when recent entries need to be accessed or modified quickly would be doubly linked list.
That is because the node in doubly linked list has reference to both the previous and the next node. We could traverse backwards from the tail to more quickly access the recent entries.

### **(c)**
Describe how the **stack** data structure follows the **LIFO principle**, and explain why this makes it **particularly suitable** for modeling **transaction undo systems** or **rollback operations** in point-of-sale software.

**[3 marks]**

---
**Answer**

LIFO refers to Last in, First out principle this means the last element added will be the removed first.
A stack is suitable for modeling transaction undo systems or rollback operations because those depend on chronological order.
The most recent action/data is easiest to retrieve or remove.

---

### **(d)**
State **one disadvantage** of using a stack for this transaction system if the store also needs to **generate daily reports sorted by time** or **search for a customer by name**.

**[2 marks]**

---
**Answer**

One disadvantage of using stack for this transaction is that it can't traverse and search through all element or sort it by an attribute.
To search for a customer by name you still need to traverse through the whole data set until you find it, as stack only allows you to interact with most recent data. The time complexity is O(n) which is very inefficient.

---



### **Task 1 (c): Binary Search Application**

The store now wants to **quickly find a customer by name** in a **separate sorted array** of customers (not the linked list). The array is sorted alphabetically by name.

Write a **binary search method** (not in the list class) that searches for a customer by name and returns the index, or -1 if not found.

Assume you are given:
```java
Customer[] sortedCustomers; // sorted by name
```

Write the method:
```java
public int binarySearchCustomer(Customer[] arr, String targetName)
```

You may assume `Customer` has a `getName()` method.

> ðŸ”Ž *Note: This tests understanding of binary search preconditions (sorted data) and implementation.*

---
**Answer**

```java 
public int binarySearchCustomer(Customer[] arr,String targetName){
    int low = 0; 
    int high = arr.length-1;
    while(low<= high){
        int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
        if(arr[mid].compareTo(targetName)==0){
            return mid;
        }
        if(arr[mid].compareTo(targetName)<0){
            low= mid+1;
        }else {
            high = mid -1;
        }
    }
}
```

## **Question 2: Stack Applications**

### **Standard Stack Operation**

You are given a **stack of integers**. Write a method that **reverses the stack** using **only one queue** as auxiliary storage.

You may only use standard stack and queue operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`).

Write the method:
```java
public void reverseStack(Stack<Integer> stack)
```

**[6 marks]**

> ðŸ’¡ *Hint: Use the queue to temporarily store elements, then re-push them back.*

---
**Answer**
```java 
public void reverseStack(Stack<Integer> stack){
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    while(!stack.isEmpty){
        Integer temp = stack.pop;
        queue.enqueue(temp);
    }
    while(!queue.isEmpty){
        Integer temp = queue.dequeue();
        stack.push(temp);
    }
}
```
